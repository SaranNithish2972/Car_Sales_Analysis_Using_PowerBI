# Car_Sales_Analysis_Using_PowerBI

This project focuses on analyzing car sales data using PowerBI. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has been conducted, and visualizations have been created to gain insights into the data. The data warehouse has been designed using both starflake and snowflake schema methodologies to support the analytical requirements.<br>
Starflake Schema: A data warehouse schema that combines elements of both star and snowflake schemas, featuring a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables, some of which may be normalized.<br>
Snowflake Schema: A data warehouse schema design where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables, creating a hierarchical structure, optimizing storage efficiency and data integrity.
